# Benchmarking Confidence Ensembles with LAMDA-TALENT

This folder contains the files and the results related to the banchmark of confidence ensembles with the framework LAMDA-TALENT.
The framework is available at https://github.com/qile2000/LAMDA-TALENT
If you are using this framework, please refer to the paper "TALENT: A Tabular Analytics and Learning Toolbox", which is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04057

## Benchmark Results

Below we report the results of the benchmark of confidence ensembles against some algorthms in LAMDA-TALENT.
Results are averaged across datasets in LAMDA-TALENT that suit binary and multi-class classification (more than 100).
The plots follow a style similar to that of LAMDA-TALENT's paper, albeit not the same as there is no script available for plotting: thus we made our best to deliver results with similar pictures.



## Benchmark Details

These are the steps we followed to execute the benchmark:
